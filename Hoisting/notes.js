//* undefined + undefined = NaN

//! function

//* declaration function can be called inside its block again recerssion
///* expression function can't apply that

//* hoisting is applied on decalartion function
//* hoisting can't be applied on expression function
//! if usage before declaration,

//! encapsulation:
//* gather all info related a certain thing and put in a certain container which is called object
