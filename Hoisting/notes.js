//! Hoisting:

//* Javascript does hoisting to any variable or func or obj or class declaration to the start of any block
//* that this variable is declared in
//* global scope, block scope, function scope

//* undefined + undefined = NaN

//! encapsulation:
//* gather all info related to a certain thing and put in a certain container which is called object

//~ example
// console.log(data);
// let data;

//! ReferenceError: Cannot access 'data' before initialization
