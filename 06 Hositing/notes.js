//! Hoisting:

//* Javascript does hoisting to any variable or func or obj or class declaration to the start of any block
//* that this variable is declared in
//* global scope, function scope

//* undefined + undefined = NaN

//! encapsulation:
//* gather all info related to a certain thing and put in a certain container which is called object

//~ example
// console.log(data);
// let data;

//! ReferenceError: Cannot access 'data' before initialization

//& Title: Hoisting in JavaScript â€“ A Study Guide

//? Overview:
//* In JavaScript, variable declarations made with 'var' are hoisted to the top of their
//* enclosing scope (a function scope, or global scope if not within a function).
//* This means the declaration is processed before any code is executed, but the assignment
//* remains where it is, which can lead to unexpected behavior if not understood fully.

//& Title: Example of Hoisting with var

//* Original Code:
var x = 5;
if (true) {
  console.log(x); // Expected output: 5
  //* At this point, 'x' has been hoisted to the global scope and was previously assigned as 5.
  var x = 6;
  //* Although the declaration is hoisted, the assignment to 6 happens here after the first console.log.
}
console.log(x); // Expected output: 6
//* After the if block, 'x' now holds the updated value 6 since there's only one 'x' in the global scope.

//? How Hoisting Works in This Example:
//* When JavaScript processes the code, it effectively interprets it like this:

var x; // Declaration hoisted to the top of the scope
x = 5; // Initial assignment occurs
if (true) {
  console.log(x); // Logs 5 because x is already defined and holds 5
  x = 6; // Assignment updates the value of x to 6
}
console.log(x); // Logs 6 since x has been updated

//? Key Takeaways:
//* 1. **Declaration vs. Assignment:** Only variable declarations (e.g., "var x;") are hoisted.
//*    The assignments (like "x = 6") remain in place and execute in order.
//* 2. **Scope Level:** 'var' does not create block scope; even inside an 'if' block, the variable
//*    is hoisted to the surrounding function or global scope.
//* 3. **Contrast with let/const:** Variables declared with 'let' or 'const' are block-scoped and
//*    are not hoisted in the same manner as 'var', which can help avoid some of these issues.
