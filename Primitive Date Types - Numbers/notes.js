//! Numbers

//* Numbers in JS is an application of IEEE S754

//* JS is applied double precision 64 bit binary

//* everytime we increase the decimal part, the precsion of a number increases

//* precision in computer is measured by bit

//* single precision equals 32 bit
//* double precision equals 32 * 2 = 64

//* maximum precison needed in like fintech is 5 decimals

//* 7 decimals is much

//* in c#:
//* there is data type is float which 32 bit
//* double is 64bit
//* decimal is 128 bit

//* in ieee 754 std it converts a decimal number to binary by
//* dividing it into 3 parts:sign , exponent,mantissa
