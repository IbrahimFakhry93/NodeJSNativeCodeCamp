//! 33 – The Compiler and the Interpreter

//* machine language is the cpu instructions

//* subroutines following, programming systems (flow-matic code) which is the seed of programming language

//* programming sysytem was in purpose for something, flowmatic was for files, others for math

//* programming systems is close to english language

//* compiler: convrt programming systems to cpu instructions

//* compiler after converstion,to machine language, produces output executable file (.exe) to use later when needed without recompiling again

//* interpreter: once it intrepoeter converts the high level code code into machine code, it executs it directly (no executable file storage) (like in python , php)

//* code that is written by human is  called high level code

//^======

//? compiler"

//* high level code -> lexical analysisi (convert code into tokens) -> syntax nalysisi (check if tokens combine correct syntax statements) -> type analysiis (check dat atype)

//* after than produces intermediate representation (لغة وسيطة ) , intermediate between high level code and cpu instructions

//* there are specilaized programmers in compier programming

//* it is easier for compiler programmers to conver t intermediate representation to machinela gnuag ethan converting high level code to machine language

//* then optimization of intermediate representatio middle end, produces optimized code
//* machiine language code level which is called backedn

//* the clinet needs executable file not the source code
//^======

//? interpreter:
//* clinet needs the source code because there is no executable file

//* every company which makes compiler or interperter is different than other company in the way of producing the complier or interpret to do their jobs

//^===========

//* js code runs in browser .e.xe file
//* C# and Java prgrams to run , it runs in runtime to contine converting th esource code into executable code
//* this runtime sometimes is callled proceess virutual machiene interppreter
